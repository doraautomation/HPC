# Parallel K-Means Performance Evaluation

This project compares a **sequential** K-Means implementation with a **parallel, optimized** version that uses Numba JIT compilation, SIMD, and blocking (tiling) to improve performance.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the script:
   python Part-1.py
